## Introduction
**Blooming** is a breakup healing app designed to support users through self-growth and meaningful connections. With two main features, Blooming helps users on their healing journey. 

The `Self-Growth` feature offers tailored tasks and activities to promote personal development empowered by recommendation algorithms, empowering users to turn this challenging time into an opportunity for self-improvement. 

The `Find Your Match` feature lets users input their breakup experiences and preferences for a conversation partner, connecting them with others who resonate with their journey. The closest connection is found using BFS algorithm to help users find someone most similar to their condition, so that they can truly relate to. 

The main goal of this app is to foster understanding and comfort in shared experiences, so as to better heal the broken-up people and help them move on.
